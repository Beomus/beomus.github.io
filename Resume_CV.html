        <!--About me-->
        <h2 id="about-me">About me</h2>
        <p>I like to program and to reverse-engineer things. The very first programming language I learned was Pascal. I never got serious with coding until mid 2019 and one of my first "program" was a basic script to clean up files in Python. Then I started playing around with AI/ML...</p>
        <p>I love learning and have become quite proficient at the art of self-teaching. I also enjoy writing every now and then, check out <a href="./Technical Writing.html">random codings</a> and <a href="./Thoughts.html">thoughts</a>.</p>
        <p><a href="./Gallery.html">Photography</a> is also a part of my life that captures other activities I enjoy such as hiking, biking, cooking, coffee, and calisthenics.</p>
